/**
 * A model proxy represents a model for a specific presentation context and
 * fires deltas to notify listeners of changes in the model. A model proxy
 * is created by a model proxy factory.
 * <p>
 * When an element is added to an asynchronous viewer, its associated model proxy
 * factory is queried to create a model proxy for that element. The model proxy
 * is then installed into the viewer and the viewer listens to model deltas
 * in order to update that element. Generally, a model proxy factory creates
 * model proxies for root elements in a model, and then represents all elements
 * within that model for a specific presentation context. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface. Implementation of this interface
 * must subclass {@link AbstractModelProxy}.
