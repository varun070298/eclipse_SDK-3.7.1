/**
 * This class can be added to the update search request
 * to filter out features that do not match the current
 * environment settings.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.

 * @see IUpdateSearchFilter

 * @deprecated The org.eclipse.update component has been replaced by Equinox p2.
 * This API will be deleted in a future release. See bug 311590 for details.
