 * Generic content consumer.

 * Clients may implement this interface. However, in most cases clients 
 * will only use the content consumer provided by the feature type(s)
 * implemented by the platform.

 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
