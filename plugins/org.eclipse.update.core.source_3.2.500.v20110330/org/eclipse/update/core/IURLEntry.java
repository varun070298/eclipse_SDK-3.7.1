 * URL entry is an annotated URL object. It allows descriptive text to be
 * associated with a URL. When used as description object, the annotation
 * typically corresponds to short descriptive text, with the URL reference
 * pointing to full browsable description.

 * Clients may implement this interface. However, in most cases clients should 
 * directly instantiate or subclass the provided implementation of this 
 * interface.

 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
