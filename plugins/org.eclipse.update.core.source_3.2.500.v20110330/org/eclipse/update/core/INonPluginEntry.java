/**
 * Non-plug-in entry defines an arbitrary non-plug-in data file packaged
 * as part of a feature. Non-plug-in entries are not interpreted by the
 * platform (other than being downloaded as part of an install action).
 * They require a custom install handler to be specified as part of the
 * feature. Note, that defining a non-plug-in entry does not necessarily
 * indicate the non-plug-in file is packaged together with any other
 * feature files. The actual packaging details are determined by the
 * feature content provider for the feature.
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface. However, in most cases clients should 
 * directly instantiate or subclass the provided implementation of this 
 * interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
