/**
 * Feature content consumer.
 * A feature content consumer is an abstraction of each feature internal
 * packaging mechanism. It allows content to be stored into a feature in
 * a standard way regardless of the packaging mechanism used. Only concrete
 * features that support storing need to implement a content consumer. 
 * The platform implements at least one feature type supporting content
 * consumer. This is the feature type representing a locally-installed
 * feature.
 * <p>
 * A feature content consumer delegates the storage of plug-in and 
 * non-plug-in files to a generic content consumer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface. However, in most cases clients 
 * will only use the feature content consumer provided by the feature type(s)
 * implemented by the platform.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
 * </p>
 * @see org.eclipse.update.core.IContentConsumer
 * @since 2.0
 * @deprecated The org.eclipse.update component has been replaced by Equinox p2.
 * This API will be deleted in a future release. See bug 311590 for details.
